    + Review google places api
    + Use google places api to find hospitals in Mayfield, KY
    + See if specifying a locationbias will give multiple results

It looks like we need to use the text search API.

    + Use google places text search API to get multiple results

```
'types': ['hospital', 'health', 'point_of_interest', 'establishment']
```

I think Google might automatically filter the results.

    _ Filter results so that we only get large hospitals

Now let's productionize the code and package it into a tool.

I think what we will be writing is a thin wrapper around the google places text search API.

    + Productionize script
    + Write configuration file
    + Test with self contained server
    + Transform script into a CrossCompute tool
